# JerseyStem-Powerpoint-Presentations

Informational Slides during my volunteer time in JerseySTEM from August 2018 to September 2018. There are four presentation slides in this repo: Conditionals, Loops, Functions and Exercises for Javascript.

## Conditionals
This presentation goes over the basic if, else, and else if conditionals when learning how to code by including intuitive examples encounter in everyday life (i.e. "If I run fast, then I will get tired more quickly"). It also includes information on operators such as or, equal to, and, not, less than and greater than. It ends with an exercise for students to use their newfound knowledge to create a simple "grade checker" at the end of the lesson using Javascript.

## Loops
This lecture includes information on loops with coding by comparing them to examples in life (i.e. "Please bring all the pizzas from the car into the house until there are no more"). The importance of loops in code, keywords such as iteration and break, and type of loops such as while and for are discussed along with code snippets to follow along. The lesson ends with the classic FizzBuzz exercise to practice in Javascript.

## Functions
This lesson explains the importance of functions for keeping code organized and to help with debugging. Along with some thinking exercises and code snippets to follow along, this lesson focuses on the anatomy and syntax of functions in Javascript as well as key words like return, function calls and how they are done, and paramaters that can be passed to these functions. The end of the lesson includes a simple "greeting" program to take a name and age passed in and create a greeting for a person.

## Exercises for Javascript
This is the final lesson which concludes the 4CoreConcepts for JerseySTEM which are variables, functions, conditionals, and loops. This lecture is a review of the last three and includes small exercises to practice new foundational skills of programming in Javascript along with code snippets as examples.
